Codebook for run_analysis.R
Create to satisfy the class project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" class
Version 1.0
Created by Tim Nichols
===================================================

This R script accomplishes the following overall analysis goals:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The only non-base package used by the code was "reshape2".  Please make sure that his package exists in your environment before executing the script.  Detailed processing steps are documented within the run_analysis.R script itself.
